# Discord Interaction - Slay the Spire Mod

This is a heavily inprogress mod designed to allow people to interact with a game of Slay the Spire using Discord.

It allows them to draw and play cards to interact with an active game.

# Notes

There is currently no notification IN GAME about actions viewers take, other than the actions themselves.
AKA, the player will see damage dealt or block applied, but not why it was done.


This is my first time using Java in years, and I apologize to whoever views this repository and comes out with a headache.
